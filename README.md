## New in Version 0.3.x

* Support for [React Suspense](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html) and lazy loading of components (see below for details)!

## Installation

```bash
$ npm i splashr
```

or

```bash
$ yarn add splashr
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Splashr has a peerDependency on React 16.8.0 or greater.

## Basic Usage

Here is a simple example use of Splashr.

```js
import Splashr from 'splashr';

const splash = (
  <div className="splash-screen">
    Welcome to my app
  </div>
);

const App = () => (
  <Splashr splash={splash}>
    <div className="app">
      This is my app.
    </div>
  </Splashr>
);
```

### Props

Here are some of the props that you can use to customize Splashr. (\* = required)


| Parameter | Description                                |
| :-------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| `splash`\*     | Your rendered splash screen. |
| `children`\*     |  Your app.  |
| `minDelay`     |  How long to show the splash screen in msecs. Default = 2000  |
| `extend`     |  A boolean that will extend the splash screen. Set to `true` to extend the splash screen past `minDelay`, maybe to load a resource. Default = `false`.   |
| `transitionTime`     |  By default, Splashr will transition between the splash screen and your app. This value will set the transition time in msecs. To disable the transition, set `transitionTime` to 0. Default = 700  |
| `transitionTimingFunction`     |  The string representing the [timing function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-timing-function) to perform on the transition. Default = "ease"  |

## Suspense

Starting with version 0.3.0, there is support for React Suspense and lazy loading.

Let's say you lazy load some components. With Suspense,
the splash screen will remin visible for _at least_ 2 seconds
(by default, or whatever value you speify in `minDelay`),
but possibly longer if the components have yet to load.
This is very useful for slower 2G/3G connections on mobile devices.

One might do this to get the splash screen rendered as soon as possible while the rest of the app is sill loading (or
[First Meaningful Paint](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/first-meaningful-paint)).

To support Suspense, simply change `<Splashr>` to `<Splashr.Suspense>`.
All props are supported except `extend`, which is ignored with `<Splashr.Suspense>`.

```js
import Splashr from 'splashr';

const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));
const AnotherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./AnotherComponent'));

const splash = (
  <div className="splash-screen">
    Welcome to my app
  </div>
);

const App = () => (
  <Splashr.Suspense splash={splash}>
    <div className="app">
      <OtherComponent />
      <AnotherComponent />
    </div>
  </Splashr.Suspense>
);
```

### Why not just use React's `Suspense`?

`Splashr.Suspense` is simular to React's built-in `Suspense` (in fact it's built on top of it), but supports a smooth transition between the splash screen and the rest of the app. it also supports a `minDelay`, which React's `Suspense` does not.

## Sample Apps
